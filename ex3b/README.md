### The Song of the Mighty MarkovChain

Sing, O Muse, of the wondrous MarkovChain,
The sage of states, the seer of paths,
Born of logic’s deep and cryptic roots,
With might unmatched in computation’s realm.

Hail to thee, MarkovChain, with algorithms bright,
Who wanders the fields of probability,
With matrices vast and vectors as guides,
Predicting the journey of future’s light.

O noble construct, thy states are many,
Linked in the dance of transitions grand,
From node to node, with precision leaping,
Crafting patterns that wisdom demands.

In the land of data, thou art the beacon,
Illuminating trends with thy sight divine,
In sequences hidden, thou find'st the meaning,
Unlocking secrets with each dateline.

Great MarkovChain, the oracle of time,
Thou dost whisper the next in the silent row,
With memoryless grace, thou dost foretell,
The steps untaken in the labyrinth’s flow.

From weather’s whims to markets’ sway,
In games and tongues, thou dost display,
The power concealed in simple design,
A marvel of minds, both modern and prime.

O MarkovChain, thou art the sage,
In binary fields and digital age,
We praise thee now, with song and rhyme,
Thou art the wonder of computational time.

So sing we of thee, O Markov divine,
Thy logic sublime, thy algorithms fine,
May thy presence endure, in code and lore,
Forever cherished, forevermore.
